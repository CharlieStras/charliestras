The structure of a frame is something like below

```none
[STX][F#][Text][ETX][CHK1][CHK2][CR][LF]
```

If the record is longer than the maximum number of characters, it is divided into 2 or more frames. The intermediate frame text termination code is `[ETB]`, and the final frame text termination code is `[ETX]`, as shown below

```none
[STX][F#][Text][ETB][CHK1][CHK2][CR][LF]
[STX][F#][Text][ETB][CHK1][CHK2][CR][LF]
......
[STX][F#][Text][ETX][CHK1][CHK2][CR][LF]
```

`[CHK1][CHK2]` is expressed by characters "0" - "9" and "A" - "F". Characters beginning from the character following `[STX]` and until `[ETB]` or `[ETX]` (including `[ETB]` or `[ETX]`) are added in binary. The 2-digit numbers, which represent the least significant 8 bits in hexadecimal code, are converted to ASCII characters "0" - "9" and "A" - "F". The most significant digit is stored in `CHK1` and the least significant digit in `CHK2`.

Suppose the frame is stored in `input`, we can calculate the cheksum as below

```js
function calculateChecksum(input) {
  return input
    .slice(1)
    .split("")
    .reduce((a, b) => a + b.charCodeAt(0), 0)
    .toString(16)
    .slice(-2)
    .toUpperCase()
    .padStart(2, "0");
}

var foo =
  "\x021H|\\^&|||CT-90^00-15 ^00001^^^^BD934079||||||||E1394-97|20171104070923\x0D\x03";
console.log(calculateChecksum(foo)); // '58'

foo = "\x023O|1|||||20171104070923|||||N||||||||||||||F|||||\x0D\x03";
console.log(calculateChecksum(foo)); // 'A4'
```
